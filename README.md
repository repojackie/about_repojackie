A simple (but messy) portfolio website for displaying information all about Jackie

You may access the deployed version of this app from https://about-repojackie.herokuapp.com/ -- notice that the app is not very robust and is highly insecure. Don't put your personal information into it! :)

# Information about this repository
If you wish to clone/run this website on your own machine, make sure to reference the 'requirements.txt' file which lists all of the files included in the 'about_repojackie' virtual environment. If you are running a Unix-based system, you can run source about_jackie/bin/activate to have everything right where you need it. To run the app, run 'python main.py'. [Note: the database listed in the main.py file has been altered for production purposes. You can use sqlite or any other variant in place of the original database URI]

# Future insights
How can I make the website more stable and more scalable? Perhaps blueprinting and better routing would suffice for this. Likewise, dynamic webpage may be better than creating new instances of a page everytime. Inheritance can be used in several areas to minimize program complexity.
